# U-Net for Image Segmentation

## Project Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the **U-Net architecture** in PyTorch according to the original paper. 
The focus is on building the model definition â€” the network has not yet been trained or evaluated on any dataset.  

## U-Net Architecture
Encoder - Bottleneck - Decoder (upsampling, *not yet fully understand* skip connection)

## Future Work
Image segmentation using U-Net on many datasets
